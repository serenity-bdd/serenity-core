# Serenity BDD 5.0.3 Release Notes

**Critical bug fixes for REST API reporting, timeouts, screenshots, and test failure reporting**

This release addresses four important bug fixes that resolve regressions and long-standing issues affecting report generation, timeout handling, screenshot performance, and test result accuracy.

## What's changed

### REST API Reporting
- Binary API responses (PDFs, images, videos) are no longer embedded in reports, preventing massive report file bloat
- Large responses (>16KB) are now truncated with clear indicators
- Binary content displays as `[Binary content omitted - Content-Type: ...]` instead of raw byte arrays
- Fixes #3635

### Wait/Timeout Handling
- `forNoMoreThan()` and `waitingForNoLongerThan()` now correctly respect specified timeout values
- Fixed regression where `forNoMoreThan(1).seconds()` was ignoring the timeout and using the default implicit wait instead
- Both Duration-based and long/seconds APIs now behave consistently
- Fixes #3637 (regression introduced between versions 3.9.8 and 4.2.17)

### Screenshot Performance
- Screenshots no longer hang in multi-actor scenarios
- Fixed issue where screenshot capture attempted to capture all active drivers instead of only the current driver
- Eliminates significant performance issues, especially with remote WebDriver instances
- Fixes #3647 (regression introduced between versions 3.2.4 and 4.2.26)

### Test Failure Reporting
- Nested step failures now properly propagate in data-driven parameterized tests
- IDEs and Maven now correctly report test failures instead of showing false "passing" status
- Respects soft assertion mode - exceptions only thrown when soft assertions are disabled
- Fixes #3707

## Why this matters

- **Reduced storage costs**: REST API test reports with binary responses no longer bloat to hundreds of MB
- **Accurate timeout control**: Developers can now reliably control wait times in their tests
- **Improved CI performance**: Screenshot capture no longer causes hangs in parallel or multi-actor test scenarios
- **Reliable test reporting**: Failed tests are now correctly reported as failures in CI/CD pipelines and IDEs

## Additional changes
- Added funding manifest reference
- Minor update to the Serenity 5.0.0 migration path
