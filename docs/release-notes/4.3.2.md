## Upgrade Notes

This release represents a significant update with major dependency upgrades. Users upgrading from earlier versions should note:

1. **JUnit 5**: If you're using JUnit 4 tests, you may need to update your test annotations and lifecycle methods. The JUnit 5 migration is generally straightforward, and both frameworks can coexist in the same project during migration.

2. **Selenium 4.38.0**: This version includes the latest Selenium features and may require driver updates. Ensure your browser drivers (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.) are up to date.

3. **Security**: The removal of vulnerable dependencies improves security. Review any custom code that may have depended on removed libraries.

For projects using earlier 4.x versions, this upgrade should be relatively smooth. The core Serenity BDD APIs remain stable and backward compatible.
