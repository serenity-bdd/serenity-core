# Serenity BDD 4.3.3 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed tag propagation in JUnit 5 parameterized tests (#3694)
- Resolved issue where tags defined on test classes or test methods were not being included in aggregated parameterized test outcomes
- Tags defined using `@WithTag`, `@WithTags`, or `@Tag` annotations are now correctly preserved in test reports
- Updated `ParameterizedTestsOutcomeAggregator.recordTestOutcomeAsSteps()` to iterate through tags from each parameterized test outcome and add them to the aggregated scenario outcome
- Added unit test `tags_from_parameterized_test_outcomes_should_be_added_to_aggregated_outcome()` to verify tag propagation
- Changes in `serenity-junit5/src/main/java/net/serenitybdd/junit5/ParameterizedTestsOutcomeAggregator.java`

### Improved reporting of CheckCheckbox tasks (#3681)
- Enhanced reporting clarity for checkbox interaction actions in Screenplay pattern
- Better visibility of checkbox state changes in test reports
- Updated `CheckCheckboxOfElement.java` and `CheckCheckboxOfTarget.java` to provide more descriptive reporting
- Thanks to [@johvpoppel](https://github.com/johvpoppel) (Johan van Poppel) for the contribution

## Upgrade Notes

This release is a maintenance update with important bug fixes and dependency updates. Users upgrading from 4.3.2 should note:

1. **JUnit 5 Parameterized Tests**: If you were experiencing issues with tags not appearing in reports for parameterized tests, this issue is now resolved. No action required on your part.

2. **Dependency Updates**: The dependency updates are backward compatible. Most projects should be able to upgrade without code changes.

3. **jsoup**: The significant version jump (1.15.4 → 1.21.2) includes improvements and bug fixes. If you have custom code using jsoup directly, review the jsoup changelog for any breaking changes.

For projects using earlier 4.x versions, this upgrade should be smooth and backward compatible with the core Serenity BDD APIs.
