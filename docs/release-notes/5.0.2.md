# Serenity BDD 5.0.2 Release Notes

**Improved console output for test results and report generation**

This release improves the clarity and usefulness of Serenity’s console output, particularly in CI environments.

## What’s changed

- Test execution results are now presented in a concise, scannable summary
- Failures and other issues are highlighted only when present, reducing log noise for successful builds
- Report generation progress is displayed in a clear, structured format
- The location of the generated interactive report is shown prominently at the end of execution
- A direct link to the Serenity documentation is included to help teams interpret results and reports

## Why this matters
- Faster understanding of build outcomes in CI logs
- Cleaner output for successful builds
- Easier onboarding for teams new to Serenity
- More professional, tool-like console experience overall

- This is a logging-only change and does not affect test execution or report contents.
