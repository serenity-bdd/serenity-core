# Serenity BDD 5.0.4 Release Notes

**JUnit 5 enhancements: @TestFactory support and improved handling of conditionally disabled tests**

This release adds support for JUnit 5 `@TestFactory` dynamic tests and fixes an issue where conditionally disabled tests were missing from reports.

## What's changed

### JUnit 5 @TestFactory Support
- Dynamic tests created via `@TestFactory` now generate proper Serenity reports
- Each `@TestFactory` method produces an aggregated report with all dynamic tests shown in a data table (similar to parameterized tests)
- Supports `DynamicTest`, `DynamicContainer`, and nested dynamic test structures
- Display names from dynamic tests are preserved in reports
- Test results (pass/fail) are tracked individually for each dynamic test
- Fixes #3630

### Conditionally Disabled Tests Now Appear in Reports
- Tests disabled via `@EnabledIf`, `@DisabledOnOs`, `@DisabledOnJre`, and other JUnit 5 conditional annotations now correctly appear in Serenity reports as IGNORED
- Previously, only tests with `@Disabled` annotation appeared in reports; conditionally disabled tests were completely omitted
- The fix trusts JUnit's decision when it calls `executionSkipped()`, regardless of which annotation caused the skip
- Fixes #3572

## Why this matters

- **Better dynamic test support**: Teams using `@TestFactory` for data-driven or dynamically generated tests can now see all their test results in Serenity reports with proper aggregation and data tables
- **Complete test visibility**: All skipped tests now appear in reports, giving teams accurate visibility into their test suite status, including tests disabled for specific environments or conditions
