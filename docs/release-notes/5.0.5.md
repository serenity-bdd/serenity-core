# Serenity BDD 5.0.5 Release Notes

**Improved failure reporting**

This release improves failure reporting in two key areas: the "Most Frequent Failures" section now shows actual error messages, and feature reports now display which step failed.

## What's changed

### Feature Reports Now Highlight the Failing Step (#3690)
- Feature and requirements reports now highlight the specific Gherkin step that failed within each scenario
- Previously, you could only see that a scenario failed, not which step caused the failure
- Now the failing step is highlighted inline with a red accent, making it immediately visible
- Works correctly for both regular scenarios and Scenario Outlines
- This makes it much easier to quickly identify the root cause of failures without drilling into each test

### Most Frequent Failures Now Shows Actual Error Messages
- The "Most Frequent Failures" section on the report home page now displays the actual error message instead of just the exception type
- Previously, all assertion failures were grouped together as "Assertion failed error" regardless of the actual error
- Now you'll see the specific error messages like "Expected 'Search' but was 'Login'" or "Element '#submit-btn' not found"
- Error messages are truncated to 80 characters to keep the display clean
- Falls back to the exception type if no error message is available

## Why this matters

- **Quick failure triage**: Seeing the failing step name directly in feature reports lets teams quickly triage failures without opening each test
- **Better failure identification**: Teams can now quickly identify the most common actual errors in their test suite, not just the exception types
- **Faster debugging**: Seeing the specific error message helps prioritize which failures to fix first
- **Pattern recognition**: Similar errors are grouped together, making it easier to spot systemic issues
