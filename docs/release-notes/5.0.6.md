# Serenity BDD 5.0.6 Release Notes

**Improved failure reporting**

This release improves the "Most Frequent Failures" section on the report home page to show actual error messages instead of just exception types.

## What's changed

### Most Frequent Failures Now Shows Actual Error Messages
- The "Most Frequent Failures" section on the report home page now displays the actual error message instead of just the exception type
- Previously, all assertion failures were grouped together as "Assertion failed error" regardless of the actual error
- Now you'll see the specific error messages like "Expected 'Search' but was 'Login'" or "Element '#submit-btn' not found"
- Error messages are truncated to 80 characters to keep the display clean
- Falls back to the exception type if no error message is available

## Why this matters

- **Better failure identification**: Teams can now quickly identify the most common actual errors in their test suite, not just the exception types
- **Faster debugging**: Seeing the specific error message helps prioritize which failures to fix first
- **Pattern recognition**: Similar errors are grouped together, making it easier to spot systemic issues
