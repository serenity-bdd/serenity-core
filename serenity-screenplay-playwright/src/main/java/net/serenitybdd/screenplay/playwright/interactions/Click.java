/**
 * This method clicks an element matching selector by performing the following steps:
 * Find an element match matching selector. If there is none, wait until a matching element is attached to the DOM.
 * Wait for actionability  checks on the matched element, unless force option is set. If the element is detached during the checks, the whole action is retried.
 * Scroll the element into view if needed.
 * Use Page.mouse() to click in the center of the element, or the specified position.
 * Wait for initiated navigations to either succeed or fail, unless noWaitAfter option is set.
 * When all steps combined have not finished during the specified timeout, this method rejects with a TimeoutError. Passing zero timeout disables this.
 * <p>
 * Sample usage:
 * <pre>
 *     Click.on("#searchbutton");
 * </pre>
