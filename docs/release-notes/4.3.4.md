# Serenity BDD 4.3.4 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed step execution after failed anonymous performable (#3684)
Resolved issue where subsequent steps were incorrectly executed after an anonymous performable task (created with `Task.where()`) failed: when an anonymous performable throws an exception, the test now properly stops executing remaining steps, consistent with the behavior of regular tasks

## Upgrade Notes

This is a bug fix release. No code changes required for upgrading from 4.3.3.
