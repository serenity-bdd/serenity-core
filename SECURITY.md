## Security Policy

### Supported Versions
The Serenity BDD project actively maintains the most recent major and minor versions of the Serenity core libraries.  
Security fixes are generally applied to:

- The latest released version
- The previous minor release (when feasible)

Older versions may not receive security patches. Users are encouraged to stay up to date with the latest release.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Serenity BDD, **please do not create a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it securely via the **Tidelift coordinated disclosure process**:

👉 **https://tidelift.com/security**

Tidelift will work with the project maintainers to:
- Review the report
- Coordinate the fix
- Manage a responsible disclosure process

This ensures that security issues are handled quickly, safely, and in a way that protects the wider ecosystem.

### What to Include in a Report
To help us assess your report efficiently, please include (when possible):

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Versions of Serenity BDD and relevant dependencies
- Any suggested mitigations or patches

We appreciate all responsible security research.

### Security Update Process

When a vulnerability is confirmed:
1. A fix will be developed privately.
2. A patched release will be published to Maven Central.
3. A security advisory will be issued (via GitHub Security Advisories and/or Tidelift).
4. Users will be encouraged to upgrade.
