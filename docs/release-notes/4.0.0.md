# Serenity 4 Release Notes

Serenity 4.0.0 is a major upgrade. The most significant change is updating the library to support Java 11, in line with other popular testing libraries such as Selenium and Mockito. However, the migration to Java 11 requires changes in the module structure, which requires some breaking changes to the package structure.

These release notes will explain how to update your project to work with Serenity BDD 4.x.

The biggest change is the main Serenity annotations, such as `@Step`, which are now in the `net.serenitybdd.annotations` package, rather than the `net.thucydides.core.annotations` package as was previously the case.

If you are using Serenity internal classes, some of these may have moved as well.

The following table indicates the main changes:

## Package changes

| Module                        | Old packages                                 | New Packages                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| serenity-screenplay-webdriver | net.serenity.screenplay.*                    | net.serenity.screenplay.webdriver.*            |
|                               | net.serenitybdd.screenplay.webtest.actions.* | net.serenitybdd.screenplay.webdriver.actions.* |
| serenity-model                | net.serenitybdd.core.*                       | net.serenitybdd.model.*                        |
|                               | net.thucydides.core.annotations.*            | net.serenitybdd.annotations.*                  |
|                               | Other net.thucydides.core.*                  | net.thucydides.model.*                         |

For example:
- Replace any annotations previously in `net.thucydides.core.annotations` (e.g. @Step) in `net.serenitybdd.annotations`
- Replace `net.thucydides.core.util.EnvironmentVariables` with `net.thucydides.model.util.EnvironmentVariables`

This release also includes support for Selenium 4.11.0, a number of bug fixes, and improved support of reporting step durations for parallel tests.

# Guice is no longer used

Serenity stopped using Guice in version 3.9.8. This has no impact on most test scripts, but if you are using internal classes such as `net.thucydides.core.guice.Injectors` classes to retrieve objects such as `EnvironmentVariables`, this will no longer work. In Serenity 4.0.0 or higher, to retrieve the current environment variables, use the `net.serenitybdd.core.di.SerenityInfrastructure` class as shown here:

```java
EnvironmentVariables environmentVariables = SerenityInfrastructure.getEnvironmentVariables();
```
